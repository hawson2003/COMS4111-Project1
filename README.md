A COMS4111W class project made by Hawson Wang and Peiyu Wang.

There are more than 5000 courses provided by the 20 schools of Columbia University. Courses with similar names are offered at different levels and with different focuses. Thus, navigating through this vast catalog is extremely challenging even for senior Columbia students, who often face difficulties in choosing the courses that best align with their academic interests and career plans. Recognizing this challenge, we aim to develop a comprehensive system that gives the best information to student users.
